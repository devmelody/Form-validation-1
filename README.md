## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned
Hmm, I learnt a whole lot! Patience most importantly. I had a lot of headaches worrying about why my Js code wasn't working. The issue was mostly with JS though.
### Continued development

I'll be working on another form validation project and I hope to have less headaches this time.
